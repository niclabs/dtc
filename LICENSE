1.- The process of signing documents using threshold cryptography is protected
under the patent "System and method for secure electronic communications 
through hardware-based security threshold cryptography" 10735188 (USA, 2020) 
and 2015003766 (Chile, 2015). For any commercial use of such technology please

2.- NIC Labs has a rich history of collaboration with the Open Source Community 
and the development of the DNS infrastructure.  Therefore, we provide the source
code of our implementation of the distributed Hardware Security Module (dHSM), 
formerly Threshold Cryptography Hardware Security Module, aiming to increase the
alternatives to DNS admins for DNSSEC procedures.

3.- Also, knowing that some parts of our code are not related particularly to 
the procedure claimed in 1, we decide to extend the permission granted in 2.
